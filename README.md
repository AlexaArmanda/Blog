Charity Website with Blog

This is my web application for a charity website about hedgehogs and other cute animals.
It is done using the MVC framework and its purpose is to mimick a real charity website, which also has a blog for users to share their own thoughts.
The admins can perform various CRUD operations, as well as get authenticated based on their role, in order to access different functionalities inside the aplpication.
